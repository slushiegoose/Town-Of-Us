# Installation
## Requirements 
- Among Us

## Installation Guide (Steam)
**1. Create a new folder on `Desktop`, called `Town of Us`.**\
This can be created anywhere and be named anything, as long as this folder is easy to locate.\
\
**2. Open Steam, go to `Library` and locate Among Us. Right click on it, select `Properties...`. Then, under `Local Files`, click on `Browse...`.**\
This opens the folder containing the Among Us application.\
\
**3. Delete everything in the currently opened folder.**\
Don't worry, this will not delete the game. This simply verifies the Among Us folder being entirely clean.\
\

\
**8. Right click on the `.zip` file, and click on `7-Zip`. Then choose `Extract Here`.**\
Something different might appear depending on the file manager being used. Make sure the folder gets extracted in the `Town of Us` folder, in the same location as the Among Us application. It should look similar to the picture below.\
\
**9. Launch the Among Us application that's inside, and start playing Town of Us!**\
A first launch may take up to 5 minutes, so be patient if it doesn't launch immediately.<br/>

\
**2. Go to your Epic Games library.**\
\
**3. Find Among Us and click on the 3 dots `...` > click `Uninstall`.**\
\
**4. Confirm you want to Uninstall Among Us.**\
\
**5. In the Epic library, click on Among Us to install.**\
\
**6. Copy the Folder Path.**\
\
**7. Uncheck Auto-Update.**\
\
**8. Click on Install.**\
\
**9. Click Yes on the Windows popup.**\
\
